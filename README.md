# Current Knowledge

## Proficient

For the ISLR, I feel proficient in:

1. General Understanding of Statistical Learning:

    I feel proficient in a general understanding of data and statistical learning, which involves around building a function that can be used for prediction and inference based on the given dataset to build a model and draw conclusions. I am comfortable with general concepts such as estimating the function using parametric and non-parametric methods and interpreting model interoperability.

2. Linear Regression

    I am also confident in the linear regression chapter of the ISL textbook. Likewise, I have hands-on experience working with regression models, estimating the coefficients, assessing the model's accuracy, and interpreting the statistics results using R and Python programming.
3. Resampling Methods

    I have solid understanding of resampling methods such as cross-validation and bootstrap methods. I have used boostrap method in one of the mini-project using R and implemented cross-validation in SAS and python to imporve the models accuracy. 

4. Tree Based Methods

    I have used tree based methods such as decision trees, and random forests to perform classification and solve regression problems. I have used library such as `rpart` in R and equivalent methods in IBM SPSS 16 to build decision trees.

In general, I have good hands-on experience on the above topics due to my past work experiences and class work including Statistics with R, Data Mining, Mutivariate Data Analysis and Bioinformatics. However, I plan on revisiting these topics as I make my progress and expand on my current knowledge. The ISL textbook and class activities were also very helpful in refreshing these concepts and providing deep dive into the concepts.


## Aware

For the ISLR:

1. Classifiaction

2. Linear Model Selection and Regularization

I am aware of a general understanding of the relationship between model accuracy and its interoperability. I know that, in general, an increase in the model’s interoperability will decrease its accuracy and vice-versa. However, I often have difficulty finding the balance between accuracy and interoperability. Should we choose a simple linear regression model because its highly interpretable but less accurate or a non-linear model such as neural networks or support vector machines, which sometimes can be more accurate but less interpretable? I also understand multiple linear regression well, but I often have trouble selecting the important variables. I understand that various variables, such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Adjusted R-Square, etc., can help us choose the best model, including forward and backward selection methods. As I continue learning through the class, I want to enhance my knowledge of these concepts and apply them in mini projects.

3. Support Vector Machines

4. Deep Learning

For the Data Feminism, I am aware of:

1. Introduction

    I have a general understanding of ethics, gender, race and bias from my Ethics and Professionalism class, but I didn't had a chacne to deep dive into these concepts and apply them in real life.


## Unaware

For the ISLR, I am unaware of:

1. Linear Model Selection and Regularization

2. Survival Analysis and Censored Data

3. Multiple Testing

For the Data Feminism textbook, I am unaware of:

Before taking STA631, I have some knowledge of ethics, gender, race, and bias from my Ethics and Professionalism class, but I haven’t had a chance to deep dive into these concepts and apply in real life. After reading the first chapter, “The Power Chapter,” and skim reading the table of content of Data Feminism by D’lgnazio and F. Klien, I found the idea of taking a feminist approach to recognize the crucial role of power and bias in shaping the data quite fascinating. I want to understand how to take a feminist approach in data analysis, minimize biases and similar challenges that come with it, and practice data feminism in actual datasets/projects to create a more equitable society and promote transparency, inclusivity, and accountability.
